"""
Data-quality helpers: staleness detection for the live tick stream.

Kept isolated (and pure/testable) so the engine's snapshot-building code stays
thin. "Stale" means no tick has been received within `threshold_seconds`,
regardless of what the connection-status badge (LIVE / SIMULATED / OFFLINE)
says — a feed can report "connected" while silently no longer sending ticks.
