"""
Paper (simulated) trading position engine.

IMPORTANT — SIMULATION ONLY:
This module never places, modifies, or cancels a real broker order. It exists
purely to track hypothetical CE/PE positions and their P&L against whatever
option-chain feed is currently powering the pipeline (mock today, Dhan in the
future — the engine only depends on `OptionChainSnapshot`, so swapping the
live data source underneath it requires no changes here).

Flow:
    open_position()  -> creates an OPEN PaperPosition at the current premium
    update()         -> called on every tick; marks positions to market and
                         auto-exits any that have crossed the configured
                         Take Profit / Stop Loss thresholds
    close_position()  -> manual simulated exit
